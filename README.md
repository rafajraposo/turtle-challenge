# Turtle Challenge
Turtle Challenge coding assessment for [Letsgetchecked.ie](http://letsgetchecked.ie)

## Usage

- [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642) to execute the application.
- You need to build the application using Virtual Studio.
- After built:
	1. Open *Command Prompt/PowerShell/Terminal* and change the directory to *TurtleChalenge.Application/Bin/Debug* or *Release*
	2. It can receive two arguments when executing, the **first one is the configuration file** and the **second the actions the Turtle will execute** (e.g. *TurtleChallenge <config_filename> <actions_filename>*)
	3. If no argument is passed it will use the default values: *config* and *actions*

## Information

The configuration and action files are written in [YAML](http://yaml.org/).
There's one configuration and 3 action sample files already in the application.
